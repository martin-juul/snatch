# Snatch

> Food delivery application sample

This is made as a part of a school project at Syddansk Erhvervsskole.

## Quick start

This project has been developed on a mac. It should work on other \*nix distros.
Windows is a totally untested environment, sorry.

### Requirements

- node.js v14+
- yarn

It's easy to test if you fulfill these. Pop open your terminal and run:

```sh
node bin/postInstall
```

#### Android

_TODO_

#### iOS

The application requires iOS 13.6+. You need macOS 10.15.2 or higher to build it.

- cocoapods
- xcode 11.6
